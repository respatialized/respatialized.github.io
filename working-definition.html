And it will take a way of modeling that ordinary people can participate in so that technocrats aren't just deciding by fiat what carrying capacity means, but also so that everyone has shared assumptions about the actual limits we need to live within."</p><p>"Yep, that sounds like what we need to do. Sounds like a huge task."</p><p>"Yeah. You might even call it 'socialism.'"
