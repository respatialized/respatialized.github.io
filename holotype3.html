Usually CSS is specified one time for a whole website. Even compositional frameworks like tailwind force you to pick a predefined &quot;framework&quot; of utility classes instead of tailoring the CSS to suit the needs of the page you&apos;re trying to make.

I aim to change that.

&lt;%= [:h4 {:class &quot;emphasis&quot;} &quot;CSS @import rules provide a dynamically loaded font to a prespecified class&quot;] %&gt;

HTML is a suprisingly capable medium, but many tools designed to work with it don&apos;t offer you much of its power. They assume that automated HTML generation + simple plaintext markup means you can &quot;set it and forget it&quot;, rather than drawing the power to generate HTML into a feedback loop woven into the page authoring and writing experience.

Or CSS frameworks subtly inherit the norms of the corporate world, where &quot;brand consistency&quot; across developers is a primary goal. Blegh.

But what if you don&apos;t want to do things the same way every time? What if you want an individual page to be styled according to its own needs, instead of a brand?

That&apos;s what &lt;%= (in-code &quot;holotype&quot;)%&gt; gives you the power to do. A thousand stylesheets for a thousand pages.

I have a lot more to learn about effective HTML and CSS. But I consider this a great medium in which to do so, because it productively blurs the line between &quot;source code&quot; and textual content.
